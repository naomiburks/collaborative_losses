Use hanabi-league api endpoint https://hanabi-league.com/api/export/games to download league games. Save as league_data.json.

Run analyze_league.py and pray it works. The most enlightening code is in likelihood.py. Nothing is documented.Someday I will publish good code. Good Luck!

Code to try to find a reasonable beta distribution to fit to the data is not currently behaving well.
